# HackTheNorth Project "Timely Fit"
We built this native Android app with the idea to use audio cues to support custom interval trainings for fitness enthusiasts while keeping track of user's data through Firebase API. Users don't have to worry about turning the screen on to look at the timer. Instead, they can focus on their workout routine and get more out of their time at the gym.

We used Hack the North as an opportunity to dive into Firebase API for their authentication and graph features. We also integrated audio abilities and animation all natively using Android Studio. 

We envision Timely Fit to become the all-in-one fitness assistant in the future. A few features we want to add to the apps include: Ability to play music within the app. Ability to record personal messages for the workout commands/notifications. Motion sensing ability to count time independent workouts. Having a workout activity spinner for indecisive users, and More!
